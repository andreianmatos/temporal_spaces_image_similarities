# Temporal Spaces Image Similarities

This repository demonstrates image similarity using a pre-trained ResNet50 model. It compares a current person's image with images from a dataset of people, finding the most similar image.

## Project Structure

- `similarities.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for comparing the current person's movement texture to the past ones.
- `people.zip`: Texture of past people, a folder per person, containing its movement texture image.
- `current_person.png`: Texture image of current person's movement.
